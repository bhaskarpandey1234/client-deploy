## 🎯 How It Works

```
User fills form → Summary shown → Pay button → Stripe Checkout
                                                      ↓
                                                  Payment
                                                      ↓
                                    Webhook → Mark paid → Send email
                                                      ↓
                                            User clicks link
                                                      ↓
                                            Full reading page
```
