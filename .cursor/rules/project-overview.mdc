# Mystic Advisor PWA - Project Overview

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: SvelteKit 2.x with Svelte 5

- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Animations**: GSAP 3.13+ with ScrollTrigger
- **Additional Libraries**: html-to-image

## Project Structure
Main entry point: [src/routes/+page.svelte](mdc:src/routes/+page.svelte)
Global styles: [src/app.css](mdc:src/app.css)
Design tokens: [src/lib/styles/tokens.css](mdc:src/lib/styles/tokens.css)
Components: [src/lib/components/](mdc:src/lib/components/)
Utilities: [src/lib/utils/](mdc:src/lib/utils/)

## Dual Brand System
This app supports two brand variants controlled by the `data-brand` attribute:

1. **Asteria Guide** (Luxury): `/asteria` route
   - Glass morphism effects
   - Serif fonts for headlines
   - Colors: Love (#F06FA3), Career (#F2C14E), Destiny (#9C6CFF), Clarity (#30D5C8)
   
2. **Cosmo Note** ($10 variant): `/cosmo` route
   - Flat cards with gradients
   - Grotesk fonts (heavy weight)
   - Colors: Accent1 (#7CF7FF), Accent2 (#7AA7FF), Accent3 (#C07CFF)

Brand switching is handled in layout files via:
```svelte
<svelte:body data-brand="asteria" />
```

## Key Features
- PWA with manifest.webmanifest
- Tarot card reading system ([src/lib/tarot/](mdc:src/lib/tarot/))
- GSAP-powered animations (Altar, PalmPress, RevealSection)
- Accessibility-first (keyboard nav, reduced motion support)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)

## Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start dev server
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run check` - Type checking and validation

## Important Notes
- CSS variables automatically switch based on `data-brand` attribute
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Components are self-contained with scoped styles
- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels
